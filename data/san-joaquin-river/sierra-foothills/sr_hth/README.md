## Brian Van Lienden {endingstorage:1} Final
Constrained ending storage set to equal initial storage; if setting the ending storage equal to the initial results in an infeasible run, the target persuasion function can be used.  The persuasion function applies a penalty of $1,000,000/AF for ending storages less than the initial storage.

## Brian Van Lienden {initialstorage:1} Final
Calculated as 50% of maximum storage (up to V43).  V44: Large calibration flows in highly constrained SFPUC system were large, indicating that raising the storage to a higher value might be a more accurate representation.  Initial storage was calculated as the average of he storage outputs from V43 which were below capacity (RR).
