In 2007, EBMUD and the Contra Costa Water District (CCWD) completed construction of intertie facilities, 
including a 170 foot pipeline, linking CCWD's Los Vaqueros Pipeline with EBMUD's Mokelumne Aqueduct. 
These facilities can pass up to 100 MGD from EBMUD to CCWD and up to 60 MGD from CCWD to EBMUD. 
EBMUD and CCWD each own and maintain their separate portions of the intertie facilities and coordinate operations when needed.
A link representing the intertie allowing EBMUD to CCWD transfers was implemented in M05I20.  The link allowing CCWD to EBMUD transfers was added.
60MGD = 5.6 TAF/month
